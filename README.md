# FULL_ADDER
# Aim:
To simulate and synthesis full adder using Xilinx ISE.

# Apparatus Required:
Xilinx 14.7 Spartan6 FPGA

# Procedure:
STEP:1 Start the Xilinx navigator, Select and Name the New project. STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed. STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type. STEP:4 Type the File Name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it. STEP:5 Select the Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax. STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table. STEP:7 Select the Implementation in the Sources Window and select the required file in the Processes Window. STEP:8 Select Check Syntax from the Synthesize XST Process. Double Click in the Floorplan Area/IO/Logic-Post Synthesis process in the User Constraints process group. UCF(User constraint File) is obtained. STEP:9 In the Design Object List Window, enter the pin location for each pin in the Loc column Select save from the File menu. STEP:10 Double click on the Implement Design and double click on the Generate Programming File to create a bitstream of the design.(.v) file is converted into .bit file here. STEP:12 Load the Bit file into the SPARTAN 6 FPGA STEP:11 On the board, by giving required input, the LEDs starts to glow light, indicating the output.

# Program
```
module FULLADDER(a,b,c,sum,carry);
input a,b,c;
output sum,carry;
wire w1,w2,w3;
xor g1(w1,a,b);
xor g2(sum,w1,c);
and g3(w3,a,b);
and g4(w2,w1,c);
and g5(carry,w2,w3);
endmodule
```
# Output
![313523101-9a6c8c8c-dca6-44c6-beb3-8afb212bbede](https://github.com/RESMIRNAIR/FULL_ADDER/assets/160302888/e6b75e1e-7cda-474c-b95d-9ed2d85e666e)
# Result
Hence Full Adder Verified.
